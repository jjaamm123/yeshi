## <font size="7">Technical Features</font>

### Frontend & Client-Side Logic

#### Editorial Typography
Built using a high-contrast layout utilizing structural borders and varying typographic weights.

#### SPA Route Fixing
Includes a `vercel.json` configuration file to ensure manual URL refreshes on nested paths (like `/admin`) map back to the root index.

#### Scroll Reset Utility
Integrated custom hook to automatically force pages back to the top coordinate upon route changes.

---

### Admin Tools & Variation Tracking

#### Dynamic Row Forms
Allows administrators to append or remove individual product variation rows (managing unique size, color, and specific stock metrics) simultaneously.

#### Image Management Pipeline
Supports staging up to five images per document, generating localized client-side blob URLs for review before triggering network payloads.

#### Localized Formatting
Implements automated formatting pipes to process numbers into Nepalese Rupees (NPR).

---

### Database & Asset Infrastructure

#### Data Modeling
Managed through Mongoose schemas to sanitize incoming variations into clean array subdocuments.

#### Cloud Storage
Integrated with Cloudinary API for offloading multi-image uploads from the host server.

#### Baseline Seeding
Includes a decoupled data script (`seed.mjs`) to cleanly clear and populate the cluster remotely.
